# Amazon_Sales_EDA

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of an Amazon Sales Report dataset. The primary goal is to load, clean, and analyze sales data to uncover significant trends, patterns, and actionable business insights that can inform decision-making.

## Libraries Used:
The analysis utilizes standard Python libraries for data science:

- Pandas: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.

- NumPy: For numerical operations.

- Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

- Seaborn: For producing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

## Report Objective:
The main objectives of this analysis are to:

- Understand the structure and characteristics of the Amazon sales data.

- Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis by handling missing values and ensuring correct data types.

- Derive key insights into sales performance, popular products, customer demographics (based on shipping location), and fulfillment channels.

- Visualize these insights to present a clear and understandable summary of the sales report.
